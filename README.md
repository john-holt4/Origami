## Why "Origami"?

Origami (Êäò„ÇäÁ¥ô) is the Japanese art of paper folding, symbolizing transformation, creativity, and simplicity. Just as a single sheet of paper can be folded into infinite forms, Origami Linux lets you shape your system to fit your unique workflow. Inspired by the philosophy of *kaizen* (continuous improvement) and *wabi-sabi* (finding beauty in simplicity), Origami encourages users to craft their digital space with intention and artistry.

## üöÄ Quick Start
```bash
# Rebase (unsigned then signed)
rpm-ostree rebase ostree-unverified-registry:ghcr.io/john-holt4/origami-linux:latest && systemctl reboot
rpm-ostree rebase ostree-image-signed:docker://ghcr.io/john-holt4/origami-linux:latest && systemctl reboot

# Verify image signature
curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/john-holt4/Origami/main/cosign.pub
cosign verify --key cosign.pub ghcr.io/john-holt4/origami-linux:latest

# Create a development container
distrobox create --name dev-fedora --image fedora:latest
distrobox enter dev-fedora

# Update & maintain
ujust update
ujust clean-system
```

## üöÄ Installation

> **‚ö†Ô∏è Warning:** Origami is experimental and actively developed. Use at your own discretion.

### Rebasing from Fedora Atomic

To rebase an existing Fedora Atomic installation to Origami:

```bash
# First rebase (unsigned)
rpm-ostree rebase ostree-unverified-registry:ghcr.io/john-holt4/origami-linux:latest
systemctl reboot

# Second rebase (signed)
rpm-ostree rebase ostree-image-signed:docker://ghcr.io/john-holt4/origami-linux:latest
systemctl reboot
```

The `latest` tag always points to the newest build. Your Fedora version is controlled by the base image specified in `recipe.yml`.

### Download ISO Image

For new installations, you can download the Origami ISO image:

**[üì• Download Origami ISO](https://origami.dpdns.org/origami.iso)**

> **‚ö†Ô∏è Important Caveats:**
> - **NVIDIA Support**: This is the first ISO release and currently **only works on non-NVIDIA machines**. An NVIDIA-compatible image is coming soon.
> - **Early Release**: This is the inaugural ISO build. Please [report any bugs or issues](https://github.com/john-holt4/Origami/issues) you encounter to help us improve.
> - **Testing Phase**: As this is experimental software, please backup your data before installation.

## üîê Image Verification

All Origami images are signed with [Sigstore](https://www.sigstore.dev/) and [cosign](https://github.com/sigstore/cosign) for security and authenticity.

To verify an image before installation:

```bash
# Download the public key
curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/john-holt4/Origami/main/cosign.pub

# Verify the image signature
cosign verify --key cosign.pub ghcr.io/john-holt4/origami-linux:latest
```

## üèóÔ∏è **Development Workflow**

### Container-Based Development with Distrobox

Origami follows the **atomic desktop philosophy** where the host system remains immutable and clean. For development work, use **Distrobox** to create isolated, mutable containers:

```bash
# Create a development container (Ubuntu example)
distrobox create --name dev-ubuntu --image ubuntu:latest

# Enter the container
distrobox enter dev-ubuntu

# Install development tools inside the container
# Your Origami aliases are automatically disabled here
sudo apt update && sudo apt install nodejs npm python3-pip
```

**Benefits:**
- üõ°Ô∏è **Host Protection**: Keep your base system clean and stable
- üîÑ **Multiple Environments**: Run different distros for different projects
- üßπ **Easy Cleanup**: Remove containers without affecting the host
- ‚ö° **Native Performance**: Full access to host hardware and home directory

### System Management with ujust

Origami includes **ujust** recipes for common system management tasks (collapsible reference below for readability):

## üßò Philosophy

Origami Linux is more than an operating system‚Äîit's a digital *dojo* for creativity and productivity. Inspired by the Japanese principles of:

- **Kaizen (ÊîπÂñÑ)**: Continuous improvement through thoughtful iteration
- **Wabi-Sabi (‰æòÂØÇ)**: Finding beauty in simplicity and imperfection  
- **Kanso (Á∞°Á¥†)**: Simplicity and elimination of clutter
- **Shizen (Ëá™ÁÑ∂)**: Naturalness without pretense

Every aspect of Origami, from the carefully curated command-line tools to the elegant visual design, reflects a commitment to mindful computing. Like the ancient art of paper folding, Origami transforms the ordinary into something extraordinary through patience, precision, and purpose.
